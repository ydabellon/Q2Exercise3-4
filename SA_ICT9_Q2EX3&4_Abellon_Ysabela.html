	<h4>VICTON OFFICIAL LIGHT STICK VER.2</h4>
	<p id="product">
		A new fresh look of VICTON's second version of their Vickey bong. It may look similar with the version one of their light stick but this time they added their new logo on the light stick. If you take a look of the Vickey Bong, it looks like a key, that's because the meaning behind it is that the Vickey bong like a key to wonderland (or Victonland).
